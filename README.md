Hack-n-Slash!
=============

A totally fictitious "hacker-vs-hacker" game that's used to demonstrate some of the updates to the collections API in Java 8. It's not actually a functioning game... but it serves as a great conceptual starting point to explore the Java 8 updates!

Most of the code of interest is in the test directory.  You can see example Java 7 approaches to the problems, along with Java 8 solutions.  

## Running with Maven


If you run the tests via maven, you could end up with this message:

```
Fatal error compiling: invalid target release: 1.8
```

If so, just make sure you've got Java 8 on your ``JAVA_HOME`` path.

## Presentation Slides

I used the code in this project in a presentation about Java 8 collections.  The [slides for that presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/djleeds/java-8-collection-api-updates) can be found on slideshare.
